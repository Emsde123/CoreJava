		// Smoke testing is done every day, we don't run negative tests on the daily smoke tests usually.
		// A negative test is the act of expecting a negative result from a test. 
		// Positive tests are the act of making sure everything is working as expected. 
		
		
		// Functional testing is the act of making sure the functionality of a specific feature is working.
		// Example would be log in, search feature, add to cart, the ability to accept payment, etc.
		
		
		
		
		// Sign Off - means finished and tested
		// Ticket - user story, bug, etc
		// DOD - definition of done
