		// 														Class  - Bluendrint 
		// Classes are basically bluendrints for building programs, most of them anyway. 
		// If an architect makes a bluendrint for a house, then anyone can buy or use the bluendrint to make houses that are identical/very similar to eachother.
		// For example you can create a car class, and make hundreds of objects that branch off from the car class.
